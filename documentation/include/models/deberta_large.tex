After having success with the DeBERTa Base model, there was hope that using the DeBERTa Large model would lead to a better performance.
However, after experimenting with the large model there was an overfitting problem.
The initial intention was to allocate more time to solving this problem. However, the extensive number of parameters resulted in longer training times. 
Additionally, hardware limitations and time constraints necessitated the decision to discard this approach. Potentially, with extended time and enhanced computing power, better performance could be achieved.
