\glsdisp{nn}{Neural Networks (NN)} are machine learning models inspired by the structure of the human brain. Comprising three distinct layers, (input, hidden, and output) \glspl{nn} consist of artificial neurons. In each layer, every neuron is connected to all the neurons in the previous and the next layer through learnable weights. Additionally, each neuron has an \gls{activation function}, introducing non-linearity to the model's computations. By adjusting the weights between neurons, the model effectively learns patterns within the data, enabling it to make predictions based on given inputs.\\
Using \glspl{nn}, both classification and regression problems can be solved. By either learning the features or by transforming predetermined features, \glspl{nn} can predict the output based on a given input.
%\subsubsection*{Motivation}
%The simplicity and flexibility of these models enable easy training for making predictions on preprocessed features. Additionally, when reduced to a single linear layer, they are effective for dimensionality reduction or learned weighted averages.
