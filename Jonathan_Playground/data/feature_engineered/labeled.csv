The main reason that the experiment was able to grow as fast as it did in the short amount of time that it was active was because of the way that the experiment looked to those outside of it. The author says ""All of the students were issued a member card and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or other tasks to bring honor to the movement,"" (CommonLit 3). It is common knowledge that envy and jealousy are present in every human being, and this must be the reason that so many outside students joined. As described in the quote, there were many things within the experiment that were exclusive of outside students. The students out of the experiment must have felt a desire to join in with the other students, an indirect form of peer pressure, if you will. The experiment was ended early due to its rapidly increasing intensity, and the operator of the experiment feared what would become of it were it to continue, thus he ended it.

Another element Artistole believes is in an ideal tragedy is, ""the downfall of the utter villian be exhibited"" (Artistole, 2). Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villian, he shouldn't die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfourtune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should posess is, ""some great error or frailty, in a chracter"" (Artistole, 3). This ultimatly means that the main character, the protagonist, shall do something utterly stupid that worsens his own life.

When discussing a tragic character, Aristolte states that it is important to have a character that the audience can relate to. He does this when he says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" He states that it is important to have a character with these traits because it arouses fear and pity in the audience. He states this throughout paragraph two when he says ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" In paragraph three, Aristotle begins to discuss the importance of plot. Aristotle states that the plot of a play should not be simple but not overly complex. He states this when he says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain."" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote ""In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. "" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy ""is proper rather to Comedy"" and ends with ""those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This takes away from a true tragedy because in the end, the protagonist must face their downfall. ",1.1993611532085,3.50299574383011

Throughout this article it tells us that no matter the color, flavor, or smell they would still sell the meat. These factories didn't care for the health of their consumers and only wanted to make money, so they sold every piece of meat that they could. While reading this article it sounds like they would never let a single piece of meat go to waste even if it was spoiled and covered in mold. In the article it states, “old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.”(3). This quote from the article explains to us how they covered up the molded meat by using strong and toxic chemicals to get rid of the smell and turn the meat back to brown. The factories had no health regulations, the meat was stored in places infested with germs. The factories knew how filthy their facility was and had put no effort in  to change it. In paragraph 4 it states, “There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.”(4). This tells us how nobody cared about the condition the meat was in and how no one enforced them to follow any guidelines that had been put in place. Workers knew that what they were doing was wrong and never second guessed it, “a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.”(4). This quote from the article tells the reader how they used rat meat for sausages. These rats contained many diseases and carried poison from eating contaminated  bread. Which they thought was right to feed  humans. In the factories, spoiled meat was covered up badly. Instead of throwing away the rotting meat they found ways to use it to seem consumable to humanity while they were making it much worse.",2.55011210796677,3.20924836058688

The characters in a tragedy should also not start from a spot of despair and work towards success.

The construction of how the characters reach their final downfall is also a significant element of an ideal tragedy.

One of these is that a tragedy is complicated and heightens emotions such as remorse and fright as in the reader as the plot moves along.  Aristotle concludes, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.""  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""  To summarize, 3 elements of a tragedy from Aristotle are strong emotions stirring in a reader, the defeat of a major character or events in the plot, and one plotline that strictly follows the issue of this story until the tragic ending.",3.14321133114365,2.83495109138843

(3) Sinclair explains that these factories are willing to risk the health of many human beings for some more money. Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees aswell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminate meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner"" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, ""With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge"" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their ""family"".

These people were in the middle, which meant they do have an important role in Ancient Egypt. But there are not much idolized like the pharaohs. These types of people worked hard also because craftsmen and soliders always had to work for the pharaohs will.

To begin with, character is a big element in order to achieve an ideal tragedy. Aristotle talks about how a character should not be a bad man or virtuos man, but a man in between those two extremes. A man who is not eminently good and just, yet their downfall is caused byerror of judgement or frailty. Some examples are Oedupis or Thyestes. This is because they are relatable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Oedipus or Alcmaeon can back this up. Lastly, the ending is also a major facet of the ideal tragedy.

Aristotle wrote, ""it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and reshapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character can't be a villain because this wouldn't be a tragedy and the person couldn't be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit. Aristotle made the elements of tragedy, expressing pity and fear, making sure it was good to bad, and that it wasn't a normal error of the person rather bad judgment, clear through his writing.",2.20429441467864,3.6262817507338

It is up to the main character's choices to set up obstacles for themselves. The plot throughout the story should set a pitiful and fearful scene as well. This fear and pity should come from the character's faults. ",3.57599347516704,1.21029060124691

The Upper class was filled up by pharaohs, the Middle class was filled up by priests, nobles, craftsmen, scribes, and merchants, and the Lower class was filled by slaves, and farmers. Now, all of these places were connected to the government. Their government was basically warshiping gods and goddessess. The pharaoh was connected to the government, because he of she was the ruler of Egypt, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were blieved to be gods in human form"" (paragraph, 2). The pharaohs were thought of as gods and godessess, they were thought of as walking gods. The Middle class was connected to the government because they either helped the pharaoh directly, or they had sustainable jobs to sell things to people, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests.

The nobles and soldiers held the Middle class, because they weren't as wealthy as the pharaohs, but they had more money than the peasants, farmers, and slaves. The Lower class was connected to the government, because their jobs paid for their homes and food, ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toild at the discretion of the pharaohs or nobles.

The second element of an ideal tragedy is that the emotions and experiences had by the character must appear relatable to the reader as these are the precise emotions that a tragedy aims to make the reader feel.  By allowing the reader to actually feel tragedy they are left with the emotions of a tragic conclusion which brings me to the final aspect of an ideal tragedy.  The final element of a proper tragedy is that the conclusion must remain tragic; meaning that the character must not see his conditions reverse.  By allowing the character to remain in tragedy even through the end of the story the author allows the reader to bask in the emotions that are ever-present in a successful tragedy.,2.97504546224614,2.19286538414915

In paragraph one the author writes, ""For it was the custom, as they found, whenever mear was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage."" This explains how they would put spoiled meat with fresh meat, instead of throwing the spoiled meat out. If the factory didn't put the spoiled meat in sausage, they would rub it with soda to take away the small, or they would use chemicals to enhance aspects of the meat. From paragraph two it states, ""...how the meat that was taken our of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" This explains there use of soda and chemicals to mask the spoiled meat. Next up, the factory would stuff ham with the spoiled meat using a machine and a needle. The text explains in paragraph two, ""... a cachine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled..."" This evidence further describes how they would mask spoiled meat. Finally, once the factory discovered how to take the bone out of a ham, they would insert a white-hot iron, and they would go on to sell ""boneless hams"" or ""California hams"" and fancy ""skinned hams"" which all were filled with spoiled meat. However no one would buy skinned hams, until they were cooked, and chopped up fine, which they then called ""head cheese"". Evidence comes from paragraph two, ""...but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!” These lines of text explain the procedure that happened to the hams just for them to be sold. If Europe old sausage came back however, no matter how moldy or white it was, the factoru would dose it with borax and glycerin and then pack it with fresh meat just to sell again.

This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageously and comedically evil that succeeds because of their malevolence, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audiene will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphance when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have relateable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.",3.89794064266612,3.36999122260667

Then there were high priests and nobles. Nobles were responsible for making local laws, when priests were meant to keep the gods happy. After that we have scribes next on the pyramid. Scribes were people who learned to read and write. On the very bottom of the pyramid we have farmers and workers, and then servants and slaves. Farmers tended the fields and raised animals. Servants and slaves, many slaves were house servants, gardeners, musicians and dancers. ",0.660536652150097,0.969310837140025

It has to relate to the audiance. People love tradegys that they feel like they can realate to. People are drawn more to tradegys that they feel a connection to. Another major element I believe makes an ideal tragedy is making it serious enough where the audience can feel the words. Turning a tradgey into a funny comegdy is not something people run towards. Most people want to know that how they feel is what others feel as well. If it is shown the way it is to be felt; not twisted to make it funny or less serious that people will be drawn to it more. One last element that I believe makes an Ideal tragedy is someone who is doing well and maybe is prospering has a big downfall. A tradgedy like that shows that fortune can have its tradegys too. ,1.16598048415761,1.16091187058755

A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they've made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and empathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that's because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary). If a tragedy is unsuccessful in provoking the emotions that come with tragedy, then it clearly would not be the ideal tragedy. ",3.63812632907257,3.50322573269907

Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good tradegy, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villian dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components.

Pity and fear can be drawn out of a viewer or reader when the characters do something to bring unfortunate circumstances upon themselves. For example, Romeo and Juliet create a situation in which they both end up killing themselves over the death of the other. In Greek tragedies, the characters must live with their mistakes and suffer, while in Shakespearian tragedies, the characters die. These two are similar because each person has misfortune brought upon them by their own misjudgment. This ties directly to how the character's situation turns from good to bad, rather than from bad to good.

This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906). This would eliminate the title of ""Number Three Grade"" in favor of ""boneless ham"".",3.42613276459037,3.14408917678279

The bottom of the pyramid is where the farmers and slaves came in. Slaves were captured in war and were used to help the farmers. The farmers raised animals and grew crops.

At the top of Egypt's system of government, is the gods. The gods were at the top because the Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the world. In the text it states, ""Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe."" The quote from the text shows that the gods were in charge. Next, on the system of government was the pharoahs. The pharaohs had lots of power. The text says, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects."" The quote shows that the pharoahs had a lot of controll. The pharaohs also directed the army in case of a conflict. According to the text, ""The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. "" The quote shows they had power. Then, below the pharoahs were the nobles and the priests.  The nobles held government posts, and the priests were responsible for pleasing gods. In the text it says, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Next, were the vizers. The vizers ensured that all taxes were collected. The text says, ""The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" The quote above shows that the vizers had to make sure everyone paid their taxes.Also, the scribes worked with the vizers. The scribes kept government records. They could also read and write. In the text is says, ""Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write."" This shows that they had an important skill and job. At the bottom of the structure were slaves and farmers. Slaves were forced to work on building projects. The slaves had to do hard labor. The farmers worked on the fields, raised aimals, kept canals and reservoirs in good shape, and much more. To prove that, the text states, ""Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments."" Farmers also paid taxes that could take away as much as 60% of their yearly-harvest.  As one can see, all people in ancient Egypt had  job, and that ancient Egypt's social structure is different from today. One can also see how different levels of social classes had different power.

(Sinclair par.2).  From the text it's shown that the workers would use baking soda to take away the strong odor of the sour meat, and even used chemistry to give it a more fresh taste and odor. This method saved the company money, but was wrong because it was selling people spoiled meat that could possibly make them sick. In paragraph 2 it also states, ""... some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty percent'"" (Sinclair par.2). When the stench from the meat was bad enought workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the odors. They would use much stronger pickle, and still end up selling the spoiled meat. In the end, the ways they would cover up the spoiled meat is by using baking soda, pickle, or chemistry to help rid of the odors to sell spoiled meat to consumers. ",1.79634386748499,1.75038000942855

The gods were believed to have the most power, and could essentially control what happened to Egypt's people.  Next to the gods was the pharoah. paragraph two states that ancient Egyptian ""leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form."" People called nobles benifited from gifts to the pharaoh. After nobles came priests, who made sure the gods were happy. If the gods weren't happy, they could bring floods and other natural disasters. While the pharoahs were given a lot of power, they were also given a lot of rensponsibilty. The pharoah had to command the army and deal with taxes, which they hired a vizier for. The vizier made sure that taxes were collected. paragraph five states that ""working with the vizier were scribes"". The scribes were the only people who knew how to read and write, and they were in charge of the government records.  Soldiers were next on the social pyramid of ancient Egypt. They protected the country and made sure it was safe in case a conflict broke out.  Craftsmen created useful items like tools and pottery. In addition to these things, craftsmen also made luxury items such as jewelry.  At the very bottom of the social pyramid there were farmers and slaves.  Farmers took care of fields and animals, made sure canals and reservoirs were in good order, worked in stone quarries, and built royal monuments.

The entire point of tragedy is to invoke a deep and true feeling of pity or sadness in the reader, something they can relate to on some level. a man going from rich to poor does not invoke these feelings, and neither does a man going from rags to riches. Villians falling and heroes rising cause opposite emotions than what is to be striven for in a tragedy, so a true tragedy has to have a merely ok character, usually with a moral compass that is skewed.

Pharoahs were entrusted to providing protection and all laws were inacted by Pharoahs.  Pharoahs needed help with all their duties, and  often appointed a cheif minister called a vizier.  The vizier ensured that taxes were collected, also,  the Pharoah directed the army to protect the people.   Below the Pharoahs, were powerful nobles and preists.  Only nobles profited and could hold positions in government, and preists were responsible for pleasing the gods.  Nobles grew rich and enjoyed great status from donations to the gods.  Next,  soldiers supervised peasants, farmers, and slaves.  They fought wars and stopped uprisings.  Also, skilled workers such as craftsmen and doctors were the middle class.

Only nobles could hold government posts, in the social pyramid, they were right below the pharaoh (along with priests). They profited from tributes in these positions. Nobles had great status and grew very wealthy from the donations to the gods (Noble Aims Section). Soldiers fought in wars or put an end to domestic uprisings. They also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved with building structures like pyramids and palaces during long periods of time. Physicians and craftsmen and woman made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and much more. Merchants and storekeepers would sell these goods to the people (Soldier On Section). Now on the bottom of the social pyramid (or social structure as it is called in the article), slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. They were forced to work on building projects. They also worked extremely hard at the discretion of the pharoh or nobles. Wanting to change your social status was impossible to do. A very tiny number of peasants and farmers did go up in the economic ladder. Schools were ran by priests and artisans. Boys who could read and write would become scribes and would go into working for the government (The Bottom Of The Heap Section).

The first class, and the highest of them, is the pharoh.  The pharoh is the leader of the area and was beleived to be human gods, the pharoh had responsibilities like protecting Egypt.  In the third paragraph, it states "" Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. ""  This qoute explains the Egyptians beliefs and why the pharohs were leaders.   The second highest, were the powerful nobles and priets.  The nobles held the goverment posts, while the priests were responsible with pleasing the gods.  In the sixth paragraph, it sites that ""Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.""  This qoute explains what the preists and nobles did and it shows their importance.  Physicians and craftsmen/women were in the middle class.  They made and sold jewerly, pottery, papyrus products and some other useful and wanted objects.  In paragraph nine it states that ""Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things.""  This helps explain their job which is why they were in  the middle class.  Below the middle class is the merchants and storekeepers.  Their job was selling goods the the public.  In the tenth paragraph, the author states that ""These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public.""  This qoute helps explain what their jobs were,  In the bottom class,  they had the slaves and farmers.  The slaves jobs were to follow orders, work on building projects.  In the eleventh paragraph, it states that "" Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war.

In the twelveth paragraph, the author mentions that ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!""  This qoute helps explain my answer because it explains what the farmers do for a living.

Aristotle says ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn't invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn't be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn't be too good, as this wouldn't invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn't be too evil, or else the audience wouldn't feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behaviror. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" Overall, Aristotle argues that a good tragedy should portray a character who is neither good nor bad, but rather somewhere in the middle, who experiences a change of fortune from good to bad due to some inherent flaw of his character.

Soldiers were also the ones who supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces.

Their jobs were varied and included writing letters for fellow villagers who couldn't write, recording the amount of crops harvested. After the scribes came the merchants. Egyptian merchants carried products such as gold, papyrus made into writing paper or twisted into rope, linen cloth, and jewelry to other countries. Next after merchants were artisans. Artisans created the fine artwork that often covered temples, royal tombs, and other monuments. They worked in large groups to complete engravings, paintings, and hieroglyphics. Despite artisans' skill and creativity, the upper classes often viewed them as little more than common laborers. Next after artisans were farmers. Now we're on to the lower part of the pyrimad with farmers. Farmers are the ones who harvest food. They also harvest papyrus for others(most likely scribes) to write on. Now we're on the VERY bottom of the social pyrimad with slaves and servants. The servants worked as cooks, butlers, litter carriers, and as pharaoh's dressers. The male servants also worked on royal building projects or were sent to fight in the Egyptian army. Egyptian servants did not have many rights but were usually not treated poorly. Egyptian servants could not own or inherit land. Slaves were very important in ancient Egypt as a big part of the labor force, but they were also used for many other purposes.

These practices were not limited to the unsanitary environment that the employees had to work under. having no place to wash their hands influenced the employees into ""washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage."" These quotes create an emphasis on the unsanitary practices. when it came to the meat however it became more and more apparent that the factory did not care about ethical practices because it was about the money. "" These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together."" This would create more meat and it would get rid of the rats therefore it was seen as a good thing to do. meat that was spoiled would be mixed in with good meat and covered with chemicals in order to prevent awareness of the fact that it was really bad meat. Another form of covering up rotten meat would be taking out the bone where the rotten part was found and inserting a white-hot iron. this would erase the visible trace of rotten and or spoiled meat.

In Egypt it is indeed possible to move up the social ladder though very few have done it. ",2.26157336440084,2.41216874628467

In paragraph 2, he states, ""...imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man...""  Here he states that the tragedy should show complex characters with a complex storyline so the audience can feel different emotions that should be felt in a tragedy, such as pity and fear. The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, ""...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous..."" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character's fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or unhappiness. This is truly defined as a tragedy because of  how these types of common endings surprise the audience as it might be something unexpected.",1.71031273290816,3.01364175566808

The nobles were the only ones that could have government positions. The passage said, ""Only nobles could hold gvernment posts;..."" The middle class had soldiers, craftspeople, and merchants that traded and provided goods for the people of the kingdom. To emphasize, the article states that there were merchants and storekeeprs who sold the goods to the public. The soldiers fought in wars and when there were none, they supervized the people at the bottom of the social hierarchy. The lowest class were made up of slaves, peasants, and farmers. Another example from the text is, ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers."" They were taxed heavily and were laborers for more powerful people. They were servants who often served nobles, or even the pharaoh. ",0.11884378369532,2.01793845860041

This character is flawed and down to earth in order for the audience to truly empathize with the hero's fatal flaw and sympathize with their great downfall. The plot of the story should follow the hero's fall from grace as a result of their behavior and the advancement of a heinous villain. The protagonist begins the story with good luck, then ends it with bad luck (and vice versa, in the antagonist's case). The most vital aspect of a tragedy is its ending. Tragedies must end unhappily. The hero must suffer a horrible ending and the villain is encouraged to prosper (or at least to win). This is to arouse deep seated feelings of fear and pity in the audience, feelings that they are usually disconnected with and tragedies were created to help the audience regulate their (often repressed) negativity by connecting with and learning from the protagonist's fate.

He wanted to show the students first hand how this movement worked. He announced that he was starting a movement to eliminate democracy, and he started to get his students involved immediately. Jones instilled extensive rules and proper disciplinary skills into his students by the end of the first day. The movement picked up steam, and by the third day, the movement expended to over 40 students. They even had a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime. Everyone obeyed Jones. However, by the fourth day, more than 200 students joined in on the bandwagon, and the experiment was getting out of control. Therefore, Jones decided to end it by tricking his students into thinking that the Third Wave was a nationwide movement and that a Presidential Candidate would officially confirm its existence. in the end, that definitely did not happen.

The employees played a huge role in why meat was processed under harsh conditions. Workers lacked washing their hands, and the water that men washed their hands in was also ladled into sausages. Meat would be tumbled out on the floor in dust and dirt. Meat would fall onto surfaces where employees have spit thousand of times. As a result of this, meats were extremely treacherous. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs."" The meat was also in a space where rats were present, causing rats to run across the meats. As a result of rats running around, they poison them. After poisoning the rats, the rats would go in the hopper with the meat while they are processing. Workers call the poisoned rat a tidbit, and they did not care to remove the rat from the meat. This was extremely unsanitary and cruel. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it."" Workers were also capable of changing the meat into; however, they wanted them, such as turning the meat brown or making the meat ""unspoil."" They would use chemistry and machines to change spoiled meat. If it were so difficult to get these meats to change, they would sell it as a number three grade meat. According to the text, it states, ""Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as ""Number Three Grade,"" but later on, some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron."" The workers also rubbed meat in soda to get meat to go from sour to sweet and change the bad odor. After doing this, they would provide it to people over the free lunch counter.

Different social classes were involved and went down the stack like this: Pharaohs, nobles/priests, and farmers/slaves. According to the text, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form."" This perfectly explains why pharaohs were at the top of the pyramid because the text also says the following: ""Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe. Therefore, it was important to keep them happy."" What better way to make somebody happy than making them rich and powerful? The next rung on the ladder was the one held by nobles and priests, however, these were not much lower than the pharaohs. Quote: ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions, they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.""  This clearly shows that while below pharaohs, nobles and priests were still majorly important in Egyptian culture. Next were physicians and craftsmen. Quoted here, ""Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things."" The middle class was still needed and wanted, unlike the bottom of the pyramid, which was farmers and slaves. As I quote here, ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles."" Also, ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!"" These guys were given less happy lives by default.",2.79739363785553,3.25198448153534

The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families.""

Rubbing soda to cover some smell, mixing with unspoiled meat so the taste wasn't so bad, dosed with borax and glycerin, and many more reasons why the meat industry was putrid in it's smell, health, and cleanliness. In paragraph  3 we see, ""Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" This shows us how if something had expired or went bad, factories would apply chemicals to regain the look of freshness.

Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot. Aristotle compares those with a ""double threat of plot"", like the Odyssey, as second rank. He believes that it is only considered the best because of the weakness of the audience.

The character that is not successful, or  ""good and just"" will also be the charcter who isn't a bad person but is judged because of some ""error"" or past situation that is now defined as his reputation. Instances like that in movies are predictable which doesn't make them tragedies anymore. The last ideal tragedy is spectacle. The spectacle part of tragedy refers to how things are seen. Such as characters, the set up of the movie or play, how they dress and sound and other things along that line. Spectacle can occur in tragedy because everything isn't as it seems. The way the characters dress act and sound could cover up their true identies. With that being said the people wouldn't expect the nice sweet guy to be the mass murderer of the play. Appearances and how different situations are viewed by the audience plays an important role in tragedy. ",2.42869635471285,1.8297232567616

He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villian or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy.

This desire for readers to feel pitiful and fearful leads to Aristotle's second element of an ideal tragedy; for it to be emotional. Aristotle claims that an emotional piece ""is proper rather to Comedy,"" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4). Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Aristotle 3).

He describes this as, ""That of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity""(22-23). Having a more normal character makes it easier for the audience to relate to them as well as to feel for them and understand what they are going through.

Meaning that when a leader forces you to follow certain laws or rules and you know it is not okay, you will still follow it because the crowd is. For example, when Adolf Hitler was ruling Germany many of the people didn't protest against the dictator because they were afraid or they were punished. The Nazis had no real idea what was going on, they just followed orders because that is how they were trained. Jones soon realized that students were taking this experiment way farther than he had expected, especially since the class went from 30 to 43 in only three days. by the fourth day the students had shown great loyalty to the project and Jones was getting worried. Jones felt that he was losing control of this experiment and decided to terminate it by lying to the students.

Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Diction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisifing moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.",2.54906922938127,1.98471716382454

Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be relatable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity. A third element of an ideal tragedy is that a tragedy should not resemble a comedy. A tragedy has to be serious, in order for the audience to feel fear, pity, and slight sympathy towards a character.

He states this in paragraph two: ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" He goes on to explain how the audience will feel pity or fear- by portraying a protagonist who is not particularly good or evil, just an ordinary person who falls into misfortune. Second, Aristotle claims that a good tragedy should have a suitable plot that is not too complicated and in which the fortune turns from good to bad because of the characters' actions. He establishes this in the third paragraph: ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. "" Finally, Aristotle highlights that the play should not be written based on what the audience wants- ""It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure"". Those are three of the elements that Aristotle says should be in an ideal tragedy.",1.7486326808007,3.41164762595465

This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, ""A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" From this expression by Aristotle, we can sense the urgence of pity and fear to the makeup of a tragedy and from which, in line, feeds into the different objectives of a tragedy and what makes a tragedy ideal to Greek playwrights. Last, but not least, the third element of an ideal tragedy mentioned is to have a tragedy that is of a single reference and reasoning from which is the result of misassumed and misfortunate actions rather than of actual bad influence and illicit actions, as seen within paragraph 3 where it states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double...[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.""",2.37902381901034,3.02165289861063

Aristotle overall scopes the plot of perfect tragedy by revealing that the  character must be one of prestige. In his efforts to indicate this claim, he incorporates the examples of  Oediupus and Thyestes. In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further. The second element expressed is the trait within a character that allows for a downfall. Aristotle also used Oedipus, Orestes, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality. Aristotle mentions that this error in one's character should be due to misjudgment or frailty. Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune. He uses the previous two elements in order to enhance this idea by affirming that from being a prosperous individual, the character's flaws will allow him to plunder into a downfall and lose the  fortune they possess.",2.42119950312023,3.02080316987911

He mentions that the play should be complex and full of different ""characters"" and plots, instead of being simple and straight-forward. The tragedy shoud evoke a sense of pity as well as fear onto the audience over a character who does not move from prosperity to adversity (it is just shocking, not pitiful or fearful) or a character that does not face misfortune when they do not deserve it. Additonally, the swap of fortune should be from good to bad rather than bad to good, resulting in an unhappy ending. This, according to Aristotle, hightens the dramatic reaction to the tragedy. Lastly, Aristotle claims the perfect tragedy should be proper instead of comedic, should have conflict such as relationship changes and characters who are slain, and it should have plot in which is ""double-threaded"". In simpler terms, Aristotle believes the ideal tragedy is complex, has a change in plot from good to bad, and should make the audience feel pity and fear towards the actions against the main character.",2.22232010034986,1.95852822975316

The economical positions rise as they go up. At the very top point of the pyramid are the gods. Here is the order from greatest to least: Egyptian Gods/Pharaohs,  nobles/priests, soldiers, craftmen/traders, and lastly farmers/slaves. The gods are at the highest position in status. They have the right to overpower everyone. Also, since everyone praises them they believe that the gods were responsible of many things as well. Like safety. Sometimes the pharaohs direct the army or create laws. As stated in the text, ""They had absolute power over their subjects...The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. All the laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh."" Because the pharaohs/gods couldn't do all the duties themselves they have assistants called viziers which are chief ministers. They have the duty of collecting taxes from people like farmers. According to the article, ""No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" Called a ""chain of command"" the viziers have assistants as well.  They are called scribes; they are the only ones who can read and write. Now under the whole chain of gods/pharaohs there are the nobles/priests. According to the text, the only people who can develop government posts are the nobles. And priests' duties are to keep the gods satisfied. Like said in the text, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Also, the nobles grow very wealthy from recieving all the gifts of the gods from the subjects. Next are the soldiers. The soldiers fight in wars or end ""domestic uprisings."" Also, they sometimes keep an eye on farmers, peasants, and slaves. As said in the article, ""Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces."" Next comes the middle class which is made up of skilled people life artisans, craftmen/women, and physicians. The craftmen would create jewlery and other products and then sell them to make some money. They were known as the merchants and sorekeepers. ""Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public."" And at the bottom/base are the farmers and slaves. The farmers has to raise animals, take care of the fields, conduct some tasks in the stone quarries, construct royal monuments, and are responsible to keep the reservoirs and canals in shape. They also have to pay 60% of their annual harvest towards tax. ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs  in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!""  Although people can't raise their status, young boys can go to school to learn how to read/write and then can become scribes or can apply for employment in the government which would make their status rise. The slaves have to work on developing projects and put extreme effort at the disrection of the nobles or pharaohs. ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war.

""Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible"".  A plot should consist of a charceter going from joy to misery as the plot progresses.  A final element in order to form a perfect tradegdy is thought.  A charecter should have a tragic deed or mistake, ususally towards the end, in which his thoughts are shown out loud and leads to the most tragic of poems.",1.46105500827547,1.69073979171235

He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arouse both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becomming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one's misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the mistrtune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character's actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a ""good character."" The show , ""follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,"" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his ""good."" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that "" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect"" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a ""spectacle,"" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect. The best endings is one that is unhappy and shocks the audience. ",1.9233620851324,2.80701877383148

Pharaohs were believed to be living Gods in human form and given great power and responsibility. Assisting the Pharaoh was the vizier, or tax collector who used scribes, or high-level, literate record keepers. Below the Pharaohs were Nobles and Priests. Nobles held government posts and profited off of tributes to the Pharaoh while Priests held responsibility to please the Gods. One tier lower are Soldiers and Skilled Workers, or Artisans. Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings, also supervising slaves, peasants, and farmers in peacetime. Artisans such as physicians and craftsmen were middle-class people, Craftsmen making and selling jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. To stimulate the economy, there were merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public. At the bottom of the proverbial barrel are Slaves and Farmers. Slaves were captured Prisoners of War, forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the whim of the pharaoh and nobles. Farmers tended fields, raised animals, kept waterways in good order, worked in the quarries, and built royal monuments. Farmers paid as much as 60% of their yearly harvest as tax.

Firstly, in paragraph 2, Aristotle writes ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This statement shows how an ideal tragedy should have a complex plot to show how the character changes throughout the tragedy as he falls from where he used to stand.

Slaves were forced to work on building projects while farmers tended to the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good shape, worked in stone quarries and finally built royal monuments.

Early on, Aristotle establishes that the main point of a tragedy is to make the audience feel fear and pity, which requires a certain main character. This character must not be perfect or sinister. That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a tradegy must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error. That way ,the audience will feel both pity and fear knowing they could have acted similarly. Anything else will not evoke the proper emotions. All in all, Aristotle finds that a lot goes into making the perfect tragedy, specifically having the right character, plot, ending, and emotions from the audience (Aristotle).

He made the students attend a rally where he announced that this was an experiment to show how people willingly follow the crowd or create a sense of superitory over others leading to horrible things.

To make up the ""perfect tragedy"" it must consist of a complex plan, actions that include pity and fear and shock the audience. Next one must include a well-constructed plot. For example the change in the story shouldn't go from bad to good which is easily predicted but could be changed to good to bad. Finally to complete the ""perfect tragedy"" it must have a double thread of a plot. A double threaded plot is the opposite of a catastrophe this could go for the good and the bad. This hits the weaknesses of the audience. Using all three elements you can create to what's known as a ""perfect tragedy.""",0.788488185955936,2.08158424778789

At the top, of course, is the gods. Because, I mean, THEY'RE GODS. Underneath them is the Pharohs. This is due to the fact that people believe that the Pharohs were the human versions of the gods. The Pharohs held the most responsiblility and were the most powerful. They were also buried within stone pyramids. Beneath the Pharohs lies the Nobles, who essentially were the government. To quote from the text, they ""profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh."" Oh yeah, and the Preists (also up here with the Nobles) had the job of making sure that the gods were happy, and didn't hypothetically cause the destruction of humanity,  but THAT DOESN'T MATTER. Anyways, next is the middle class. the middle class, of course, was in the middle.  It contained craftsmen(men refering to both men and women, plus the possible addition of nonbinary peeps if the term hypothetically existed at the time) and shopkeepers. But what did they make? What did they sell? Well what do YOU think?? Ok, I might understand if you were having trouble figuring out what craftsmen did(which was make things such as jewlery,pottery, and tools by the way),  but shopkeepers??? I think you might be able to find out yourself. OK, MOVING ON, we have soldiers. Who, in most societies, you might expect to be higher than the middle class, but NOPE. THEY'RE AT THE BOTTOM. Well, not at the bottom, but.. Let's just say that in the egyptian society, you're either at the top, or at the bottom. And, despite the existence of the middle class, THERE IS NO INBETWEEN. So, yeah. Soldiers. They uh, fought in wars, of course, and they also supervised the peaseants and farmers...That's all I really know. Sorry. Alright, and now the moment in which you bois n gals n nonbinary pals have all been waiting for...the absolute bottom...the lowest of the lows...drumroll please...SLAVES AND FARMERS, YALL! Aight so slaves were essentially made out of a whole bunch of peeps who were taken captive during war, and such. They were used to work on building projects, and let's be honest, were probably treated like crap. And farmers, on the other hand, were...FARMERS! And they did, uh...Very..Farmer-y things. They..THEY WERE FARMERS. They also helped build royal monuments, and, to quote from the text, ""paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest"". So, if their yearly harvest were hypothetically around, let's say...$10,000, then they'd be left with...*calculating*...$4,000. So, when it came to taxes, farmers, too, WERE TREATED. LIKE. CRAP.

As democracy was expelled from the classroom Ron Jones was seem to become more of an authoritarian figure in the classroom as he told the rules and continue to make a very strict résumé for students to be as disciplined as possible. The main concern in this experiment was when he made a slew resembling that of the Nazi regime where students would have to salute to each other even when they were outside his classroom. As the movement gained popularity the new motivated students became a sort of court not letting any nonmembers into the classroom and eventually got over 200 participants. The main reasoning for terminating the movement was because students became too invested into the experiment and Jones felt it was slipping out of his control to get rid of the experiment he lied to the students by announcing that the third wave was a part of a national wave movement and Jones ordered students to attend a publicly announced presidential candidate of the movement, when the day came they were presented with a blank channel and Jones saw that as an opportunity to announce that they were a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others even when horrible things are happening.",1.49539674836705,3.10899544501482

In Paragraph 1, the text states, ""For it was the custom, as they found, whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage."" Factories would manage to hide the spoiled food into sausage or in other cans of meat. However, the meat would leave a lingering, foul smell so more attempts to hide the use of spoiled meat were put into motion. Paragraph 2 includes, ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" The factories not only managed to cover the apperance of the spoiled meat but also the smell with attempts of rubbing soda on the pounds of food.

One of the other ways they covered up the smell of spoiled meat is a pickle. Sometimes the odor was so bad even the workers couldn't stand it, so they would use this machine that had a needle attached to the meat to pump into it by foot. The story says "". And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor—a process known to the workers as “giving them thirty per cent.” ",0.239216658363737,2.17293236566335

By this approach, the text represented it as being able to alter the audience's perception of the personality and behavior of the character.

Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Oedipus and Thyestes because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character’s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good.

Primarily, Aristotle discusses about the importance of constructing a plot that goes from good to bad. Having a good to bad plot will lead to an ""end unhappily. It is... the right ending."" If this plot is able to work, the most tragic effect will be the outcome because it satifies ""the moral sense, [and' inspires pity or fear."" Moreover, an ideal tragedy needs to build emotions from readers. The perfect tragedy must ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" which is achieved by a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle makes it clear that emotions are able to occur when ""some great error or frailty"" happens that changes the character from descriptions mentioned before which makes a character go from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as ""it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators."" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it's similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be.

This cluster of text qoutes shows how legitamately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute. This not only proves how naive minor's can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is commiting said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighboor's mom told you as a kid: ""If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?""- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action. This fact connects back not only many examples throughout human history but in varying life forms across the globe.

The second element of a good tragety would the progress from good to bad fortune throughout the story.  A tragety isn't a tragety if the protagonist has a happy ending because it just isn't tragic. In order for the story to be tragic there needs to be a great amount of misery and woe involving the protagonist having the good things in life take from them throughout the span of the story. The third element of a good tragety is an unhappy ending. If the story ends happily for the protagonist then the story is not at all sad or tragic. We as people prefer to have a story end happily for the protagonist because it sits with us better. We prefer to walk away knowing that the main character got what they always wanted and that they found joy in the end.
