32f23f665431,39c16e,"According to this reading, Aristotle views the concept of an ideal tragedy by using elements of six different parts, but the most important according to him, are elements of plot, character, and thought. First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate.

25e459261b79,39c16e,"Aristotle was one the smartest philosopher's at this time and had many opinions on how a tragedy should be written. Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be relatable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity"" (Aristotle). This explains how a charcter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more relatable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'.

As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narritive as it progresses. Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.""

c028243a852d,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, there are three main elements to create an ideal tragedy within any story. The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character.

Specifically, Sinclar reveals the immoral actions that transpired in an attempt to cover up spoiled meat.  Sinclar indicates that the factories covered up spoiled meat through masking odors, reusing rejected meat, and combining normal meat and rat meat simply out of pure laziness. For example, Sinclar states that the meat ""would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" That quote in itself explains one of the many attempts in which the factories hid their corrupt techniques. Additionally, Sinclar incorporates vivid and descriptive imagery to illustrate the masked meatpacking process. Sinclar states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats."" The explanation regarding the rats and the leaky rooms emphasizes the feeble conditions located in the specific offices. Another way in which the factory workers hid their spoiled meat was by supplementing odorous pickles to the most spoiled portions of meat. This was done in an attempt to mask the stench of the meat.

The movement stared out small in his classroom, by having kids pratice proper seating and abide by strict rules with him as their leader. Jones noticed that as the week went on, students had ""a supreme sense of discipline and community"" (CommonLit Staff) and even followed the Nazi-like salute Jones had made up. By the third day, the movement had tons of students involved all of whom showed, ""a drastic improvment in academic skills and tremendous motivation"" (CommonLit Staff). All members were issued a member card and given a specific task/assignment to honor the movement. As members started to learn how to recruit more people, membership increased to over 200 students. They asked questions in three words or less and prefaced all their statments with ""Mr.Jones"". By the experiment's fourth day, Jones saw an alarming amount of loyalty and dedication to the movement. So much, that he knew he had to shut it down, before it got out of control.

c8c77fd9fb07,39c16e,"As described by Aristotle, three elements of an ideal tragedy would be that the plot should feature the downfall of a man who is not completely evil but who has a flaw which causes his downfall, that it should cause fear and pity in the audience, and that it should have a complex plot, but not a plot with two thread that has two different catastrophes for the good and the bad.  Aristotle  believes that the goal of a tragedy is to ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and argues that in order for the tragedy to accomplish this goal, it should feature the downfall of a hero ""who is neiter eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought on not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" He thinks that if the hero were purely good, his downfall would simply be shocking to the audience, whereas the downfall of a purely evil man would not arouse pity or fear, since ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" and the audience would instead derive moral satisfaction from seeing the evil man get what he deserved. Finally, Aristotle writes that while a tragedy should ""be arranged not only the simple but on the complex plan"" but that there should not be a ""double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and bad"" because in that case the sense of pleasure from the audience will not be ""true tragic pleasure"" but closer to what the audience would feel when watching a comedy.",3.90032610436019,0.556479831902046

dfb33bc8ee43,39c16e,"Aristotle stated that the ideal tragedy needs to imitate human action in order to make the audience have pity or fear for a character. In order for this to happen, the tragedy must avoid certain roads that  can be considered predictable. An example of this would be a good person facing challenges or a bad person becoming prosperous. Another example would be making the downfall of the villain a big event that has no consequences. All three of this things, mainly due to their predictability, make it difficult for a viewer to invest their emotions into the tragedy.
